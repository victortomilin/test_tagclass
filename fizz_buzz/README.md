Classic `FizzBuzz` exercise.

Count from 1 to N
1. print number, BUT
2. if n is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead
3. if n is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead
4. if n is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead

And then refactor if needed:
- Try to use only one print (output) for all cases
- Try to reduce number of conditions
- Modify to always print both number and fitting words, e.g "3 Fizz"
